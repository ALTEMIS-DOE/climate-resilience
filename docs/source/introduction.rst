Introduction
-------------
Climate resilience is defined as the capacity of an individual site to perform according to its regulatory requirements while impacted by potential stresses imposed by climate variability, weather extremes, and related impacts projected by future climate scenarios. As highlighted in the US Global Change Research Program's recent National Climate Assessment, the impacts of climate change are broadly distributed across the United States, with regionally-specific effects potentially threatening sites and site infrastructure under remediation or with waste disposal cells. Therefore, we developed the climate-resilience package (https://pypi.org/project/climate-resilience/) to aid the long-term climate resilience and vulnerability assessment for soil and groundwater-contaminated sites.
